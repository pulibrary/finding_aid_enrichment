# Loading Files into GraphDB
We can load two different kinds of graph into the triple store: graphs of data in CRM and IIIF manifests.  This directory contains scripts for doing this.

Before you can load data, you have to set up a repository to load it into.  Use the GraphDB workbench to create a repository
