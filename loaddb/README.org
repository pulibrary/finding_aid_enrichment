* Loading Files into GraphDB
We can load two different kinds of graph into the triple store: graphs of data in CRM and IIIF manifests.  This directory contains scripts for doing this.

## Before You Start
Before you can load data, you have to set up a repository to load it into.  Use the GraphDB workbench to create a repository

Once you have GraphDB running and a repository set up (we'll call ours test for now), you can load the triples.  It doesn't matter what order you load them in; here we'll start with the manifests.

#+begin_src shell
  python manifest_loader.py ColdWarPapers/MC076/subseries_1a/manifest_list.txt test http://localhost:7200
#+end_src

Next, we'll load the CIDOC-CRM schema.  We can use the GraphDB Workbench application to do this.

Finally, we'll upload the data.

#+begin_src shell
  python ttl_loader.py ~/Desktop/ColdWarPapers/MC076/subseries_1a/data
#+end_src

This will take some time, depending on your server.
