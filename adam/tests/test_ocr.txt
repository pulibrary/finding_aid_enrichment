incentives for the private sector, will further speed the recovery,
In addition, the Indian Federal Reserve Bank is easing credit to
stimulate investment,

On the negative side, the revolution in food production is likely

to create a new cron of volitical problems. Although the vast land
holdings which in British days were in the hands of the "Zamindars"
have largely been broken uv by legislation passed in the 1950's,

this legislation contains many loovholes. Consequently the incomes
of the land-owning cultivators will continue to rise sharply while
the incomes of the sharecropvers and landless laborers will lag
behind.

Inevitably the larger land-owners will ultimately become the
volitical target for Communist agitators with their Leninist/Mao
Tse-tung slogan of "land to the tillers." Many Indian leaders
are beginning to recognize that a way must be found to give the
landless a more generous share of the new prosnerity,

In addition there will be many difficulties involved in the procure-
ment and distribution of the foodgrain surpluses. This will call for
new administrative techniques to keev prices within reach of the
urban consumer, yet high enough to vrovide ample incentives for
the cultivators. The present plan calls for government controlled
reserve stocks of six or seven million tons, some of which for

the next three or four years will come from gradually reduced
purchases from the United States under PL 480,

A particularly difficult develoomental vroblem arises because much
of the burgeoning new wealth being created by the rural revolution
(agriculture vroduces half of the gross national income) is beyond
the reach of the Central Government's tax system. Authority to
tax land and agricultural income rests with the States, which are
under heavy vressure from cultivator lobbies to opvose or at least
curtail all taxes on land and farm income.

This tax dilemma is comvounded by the fact that much of the capital
investment which is so urgently needed in industry is being diverted
into land sveculation, both uft<en and rural. The Central Govern-
ment increasingly recognizes this problem and is now seeking to
devise tax measures which will discourage the speculators and
mnrovide increasing rewards to the entrepreneurs.
